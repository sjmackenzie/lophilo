# Lophilo Squeeze

Debian Squeeze is a specialized lightweight distribution available for ARM architecture (armel) that can be easily bootstrapped from the network and is stripped down to the minimum (no man pages and documentation).

We've adapted the installation procedure to the Lophilo platform.

## setup

See Lophilo/squeeze/Makefile for setup of instructions

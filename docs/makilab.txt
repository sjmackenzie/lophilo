Nils: I've delivered your six-pack of German beers to Jonathan Buford at Makilab! 

Makilab is home to the soon-to-be 300$USD 3d printer (+shipping). Their goal is to bring affordable and reliable 3d printing to the masses. A week ago, they were still using the space at Dimsum Labs. Now Makilab has it's own space in the New Territories in a factory building five minutes away from the Kwai Hsing subway station. 

They've got the two essential things setup: the coffee machine and the Internet connection! Their space is comfy at about 307 square meters (3300 square feet) with 7 employees so far and room to grow quickly. The contractors are finishing up and by the end of the day the office will be cleaned up to full readiness to start churning out these 3d printers. 

Production is near... Jon and Andres (mechanical engineer) were hard at work in the space when I came in, with a few of the other engineers out on a shopping spree. Almost all parts they need to build the 3D printer is already in stock and they're tweaking the final prototype of the design. They will self-distribute the product which will come as a kit that their customer can assemble. 

Going with them to this event tonight: hktailor-eorg.eventbrite.com
